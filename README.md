## Introduction
This repository contains a dataset of credit card customers and their churn status, along with a Python code implementation of a Random Forest model used to predict customer churn. The model aims to identify individual customers who are at risk of churning, which is a crucial task for businesses to retain their customers and ensure their loyalty.

## Dataset
The dataset included in this repository provides information about various attributes of credit card customers, such as their age, gender, education level, usage of credit cards, and more. It also includes the target variable, which indicates whether a customer has churned or not.

## Model
We have implemented a Random Forest model using Python and the popular Scikit-Learn library. Random Forest is a robust machine learning model that can handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions. In this project, we've fine-tuned the model to predict customer churn based on the dataset's features.


## Analysis




## Usage
To use this model, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local environment.
* Install the necessary Python packages listed in the requirements file.
* Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script that contains the Random Forest model implementation.
* The model will predict customer churn based on the provided dataset.
* You can also customize and extend the model to suit your specific business needs.
